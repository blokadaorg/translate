<h4>Who is a Patron?</h4>
<p>Blokada Patron is an individual or organisation whose effort or contribution is particularly appreciated by the Blokada community. For a month, Patron can promote any content (criteria apply) to every Blokada user. A new Patron is chosen by the community once a month.</p>

<p>If you enjoy Blokada and want to support its development, becoming a Patron is a great way to do so!</p>

<h4>How will my content be displayed?</h4>
<p>Your content (a website, video, etc) will be prominently promoted in a screen displayed just after opening Blokada app. It is displayed once for every new user, and once after every app update. This guarantees that every impression is having user attention.</p>

<h4>What are the criteria?</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Your website cannot contain any content deemed unsuitable by the Blokada community.</li>
<li>Your website cannot be visually obtrusive, bloated or load slowly.</li>
<li>Consider the fact Blokada community does not like advertisement. You should generally only promote products and services for good cause and/or beneficial for the community.</li>
<li>You must have made a sizeable contribution towards Blokada development. It can be a donation, code contribution, free services offered for the community, or else. It's the Blokada community who decides in the end, by voting, whether your contribution fulfills the criteria.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>How to apply?</h4>
<p><ol>
<li>Apply using the link at the top.</li>
<li>You will get a response promptly.</li>
<li>If accepted, your application will be included in the next voting of the Blokada community.</li>
