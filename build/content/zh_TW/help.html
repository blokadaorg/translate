<h4><a name="adblock">廣告阻擋</a></h4>
  <p>Blokada 最著名的功能是廣告攔截。 它是個介於電話的網路介面（WiFi 或行動網路）及你使用的應用程式之間的一個薄層。 為了過濾每個連出的流量，它使用了您裝置的 VPN API，並阻擋所有定義在封鎖清單過濾規則的所有請求。 當應用程式嘗試存取被封鎖的主機名稱，此封鎖就會回應「找不到主機名稱」給應用程式。 因為如此，Blokada 可以同時節省您的行動網路流量、電池壽命與時間：因為其並未使用重新導向。 過濾器會自動更新。 您可以使用您自訂的過濾規則與白名單來設定 Blokada 以確保您想要使用的服務不會被封鎖，且不會遇到任何中斷的問題。<br>
  此功能免費提供，也將會保持免費。 盡情享受 Blokada 吧！</p>
  <p><a name="allowlist"></a>如果應用程式並未如預期般運作、無法載入其內容或某些類似的不當行為，請向上滑以開啟 Blokada 選單，然後輕點<i>廣告阻擋</i>、選擇<i>已允許的主機</i>，點選頂部的 + 號，並新增一個主機名稱或包含所有您想要略過過濾的主機清單檔案。</p>
  <p><a name="blocklist"></a> 你可以阻擋主機清單上沒有的單一網站。 要這麼做，請向上滑以開啟 Blokada 的選單，在<i>廣告阻擋</i>上輕點，選擇<i>已封鎖的主機</i>並輕點在畫面頂部的 + 號。 這裡，您可以新增一個主機名稱或包含所有您想要封鎖的主機清單檔案。</p>

<h4><a name="vpn">VPN</a></h4>
  <p>在 Blokada v4 中引入了新服務，其為 Blokada 自己的 VPN。 此服務讓您可以確保您在網路上的安全與匿名，不管您在哪裡，正在做什麼都一樣。 Please refer to our blog article <a href="https://block.blokada.org/post/2019/07/11/what-is-vpn/">here</a> to know more about this feature.<br>
  This service costs 5€/month. Please read our Terms of Service <a href="https://vpn.blocka.net/tos.html">here</a> and Privacy Policy <a href="https://vpn.blocka.net/privacy.html">here</a> before signing up.
  In this section you’ll be able to manage your VPN account. From here you’ll be able to:<br>
  - Activate an account<br>
  - Restore your account<br>
  - Select the gateway to connect to<br>
As for the payment mechanism we use Stripe and the info saved in the process is only used to verify payments and keep enough information to activate the account and allow you to manage your suscription safely.</p>

<h4><a name="dns">變更 DNS</a></h4>
  <p>The other commonly used function in Blokada is changing the DNS server. The application provides a list of pre-defined DNS servers you can choose from.<br>
  The acronym DNS stands for Domain Name System and this servers are responsible to resolve the domain names (for example: <i>myexample.com</i>) to IP addresses, what are used between machines to communicate. Your internet service provider has its own DNS servers; Blokada is configured to use the system defaults. The machines in this list should be used if you are suspecting that your ISP collects logs about your internet usage, you are afraid of some privacy risk or if some websites or services are blocked for you. There is no "best", everything depends on your preferences and location, therefore if you would like to use custom DNS servers, please read their description, search for them on the internet and read the feedbacks.<br>
  This DNS section will work with or without VPN active, so the DNS of your choice will be the one used with or without the VPN service. Also consider as of v4 Blokada doesn’t support yet DoH/DoT, but this will be implemented shortly after the release of v4.
</p>

<h4><a name="settings">What are the available settings in Blokada?</a></h4>
<p>As you surely saw it, Blokada has some options on the Settings screen. You can see the followings:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Notifications</b>: when enabled, you will be notified when an ad is blocked. It is on by default, but if you get a lot of notifications, turn it off.</li>
    <li><b>Start on boot</b>: when enabled, Blokada will start after the system boots up. Please note there are system level configurations for this option, therefore it cannot be guaranteed Blokada can start on boot. In this case, please check your phone’s settings. The default configuration is enabled, if you want to start Blokada manually, disable this option.</li>
    <li><b>Settings location</b>: where do you want to store the configuration: in the internal or external storege? If you choose external, the files are available in /Download/Blokada directory.</li>
    <li><b>Background animation</b>: you can enable or disable the background animations, showing the waves. White waves represent the allowed host queries while the orange ones are the blocked ones.</li>
    <li><b>Request logger</b>: when enabled, Blokada will generate a CSV file and log requests that have been allowd and/or blocked by the app.</li>
    <li><b>Keep alive</b>: this option is to ensure Blokada is not paused or stopped by the system. Please note your system can overwrite it, make sure your settings will let Blokada run in the background.</li>
    <li><b>Watchdog</b>: when enabled, Blokada will exit if there is no active connection, and start again whenever connection comes back. If disabled, Blokada will always run in the background (even if no network is available). Please note this option may not work on every device.</li>
    <li><b>Aggressive wakeup</b>: enable this option if your device stops or kills Blokada due to the system's powersaver feature. Even though this option aims to keep Blokada alive on most of the devices, the system will always have higher priority and can stop the app if it isn't excluded for memory- or battery optimisation.
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="startup">I cannot start Blokada after I installed it.</a></h4>
<p>There are two common causes for such a situation. First, please check if you have an active VPN connection and if thats <i>Always-on VPN</i> option is enabled. To do it, go to the Settings of your phone, search for VPN in the network section, tap on the gear next to the existing VPN. Disable it, disconnect from the active VPN connection and try to restart Blokada.</p>

<p>If you don’t have other VPN connection, check in Blokada if <i>Watchdog</i> is enabled in the Advanced Settings, and if yes, check if you are connected to the internet either with wifi or with mobile data. Blokada won’t start if the <i>Watchdog</i> is enabled and you don’t have an active internet connection.</p>

<p>If it doesn’t help, restart your phone, it also helps sometimes.</p>

<h4><a name="refresh">Blokada blocks less ads.</a></h4>
<p>If you suspect that Blokada blocks less advertisements than earlier, please refresh your lists. To do it, tap on <i>Blacklist</i>, then in the top right corner on the equaliser, choose <i>Refresh filters</i> and tap on <i>Continue</i>. Usually it happens because new servers are added to the existing ones that are not (yet) identified and added to the blacklists, or the new list is not downloaded to your phone, therefore they are not (yet) blocked.<br>
Alternatively you can enable more host lists or add more restrictive filters in the <i>Blacklist</i> menu.</p>

<p>Please note that Blokada uses 3rd party lists, therefore if the app itself worked earlier and blocked ads, without changes it should behave the same way.</p>

<h4><a name="chrome">Blokada doesn't block ads in Chrome.</a></h4>
<p>If you're using Google Chrome, you need to disable Data Saver and Async DNS. Google uses those two technologies by default and they interfere with Blokada's host blocking.<br>
1. To disable Data Saver, tap the three vertical dots in Google Chrome, go to Settings, search for "data saver" or "lite mode" and disable it.<br>
2. To disable Async DNS, open the page "chrome://flags" in your browser, search for DNS and disable the Asynchronous DNS feature.<br>
3. On your device, go to Settings -> Applications -> Chrome -> Storage and clear cache.<br>
4. Reboot!</p>

<h4><a name="youtube">Ads in YouTube aren't blocked!</a></h4>
<p>Blocking ads on YT is very hard because Google uses encryption and randomly generated hosts to serve the ads. Therefore, it's much easier to block ads within the YT app as with an external tool (like Blokada). NewPipe and YouTube Vanced are featureful, great alternatives of the official YouTube application, please check which fits better for you.</p>

<h4><a name="kill">Blokada stops to function/work after a while.</a></h4>
<p>As a first step, turn on <i>Keep alive</i> in Blokada. In this case, Blokada will try to stay online, but please note, your system still can effect this behaviour. If you set it, and you still see that Blokada is stopped time after time, check your system’s settings and turn off every battery- and memory-optimisation for Blokada. Unfortunately it is different in every system, therefore we cannot say where to do it. Please check your phone’s settings. Other source of such behaviour can be that you are using a memory cleaner. Please set Blokada on whitelist or exclude list. If non of this steps helped in your case, please report a bug (see below how to do it).</p>

<h4><a name="abplists">I can't import EasyList/AdBlock Plus list into Blokada.</a></h4>
<p>If you try to import a list (for example EasyList) that works very well with your AdBlock Plus extension on your PC or notebook, Blokada will report an error message. It is because Blokada uses other method to block ads. While ABP blocks and hides elements or parts of the website, Blokada cannot do it because it's not a plugin in the browser, instead it redirects the accesses to the ad-server to a non-routable address (0.0.0.0), therefore it needs a hostname-IP list.</p>

<p>Not configurable things:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Up to date</b>: if you see it, you are running the most recent version of Blokada. Keep the app up-to-date because it has less bugs and more features!</li>
    <li><b># ads blocked</b>: the number of unwanted content that Blokada blocked since it is started for the first time</li>
    <li><b># hosts</b>: number of servers that serves advertisements, malware and other unwanted content</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="ads">What can I do if I still see some ads?</a></h4>
<p>Some ads will come through with any ad blocker on Android. In particular YouTube ads or some fullscreen popup ads are difficult to block. If you think more ads are coming through than before, try these steps:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Check if the VPN key icon is present in the status bar at the top. If not, start Blokada.</li>
    <li>Open Blokada and check if it is active and not reporting any errors.</li>
    <li>Check if the hosts counter is not equal to zero. If it is, select some blacklist filters so that ads can be blocked. If the counter is still zero, grant storage access permission in the System Settings - Applications - Blokada, then clear data and cache and reboot the device.</li>
    <li>Make sure you don't have too many apps in the whitelist - maybe that's why you are seeing ads.</li>
    <li>Try resetting your filters (go to the Blacklist screen and choose <i>Restore Defaults</i> from the Quick Actions menu at the top).</li>
    <li>If you see ads in your browser, deactivate any kind of traffic compression or optimisation in the browser's settings.</li>
    <li>Deactivate Blokada, close it (by swiping it out from the Recents screen), and turn it on again.</li>
    <li>If you recently changed your settings (filters, whitelist, etc), remember it takes time before new configuration start working. Give it some time.</li>
    <li>Clear app data for Blokada (in system settings), or reinstall it.</li>
    <li>Restart your device.</li>
    <li>If none of those steps helped, please report a bug (see below).</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="update">我無法安裝更新，我該怎麼辦？</a></h4>
<p>首先，請檢查你的 Android 版本是否為 5 或更新版本。 Blokada 3.0 及更新的版本不支援 Android 4 及更舊的版本。 要檢查版本，前往手機的設定，滑到<i>關於手機</i>並搜尋 <i>Android 版本</i></p>
<p>If your phone runs Andriod 5 or newer, please ensure you try to install the update from the same source that you installed Blokada initially. Different repositories add their signature keys and therefore the update may fail.</p>
<p>Restart your device. It sounds strange, but sometimes it helps. If that didn't solve the issue, uninstall Blokada and install it again.
<p>If none of those steps helped, please join to our Telegram chat on <a href="http://go.blokada.org/chat">go.blokada.org/chat</a> to get help, or report a bug (see below).</p>

<h4><a name="notification">我能隱藏 VPN 通知嗎？</a></h4>
<p>Unfortunately no. Some devices may be displaying annoying VPN notification (a key icon) while VPN is active, and it is not possible to hide it. If you can, try updating your device to Android 8 (Oreo), since newer Android versions do not have this status report.</p>

<h4><a name="bug">我該如何回報問題、想法或建議？</a></h4>
<p>If you are experiencing problems, please join to our Telegram chat at <a href="http://go.blokada.org/chat">go.blokada.org/chat</a>, where our community is happy to help you.

Please provide as much information as you can and steps to reproduce the same issue - it helps greatly in fixing your problem! If you are a pro user, you can go directly to the issue tracker at GitHub.</p>

<h4><a name="private">Blokada 能看到我的隱私資料嗎？</a></h4>
<p>不會。 Blokada does not read or tamper with your private information, it only monitors which hosts your device is making requests towards and blocks the ones matching the filters. Every time Blokada blocks anything, you will see a notification (what you can turn off). Blokada has no access to your encrypted traffic.</p>

<h4><a name="battery">Blokada 會不會使用很多電力？</a></h4>
<p>No. Depending on your settings the battery impact is minimal, and on most new devices, especially on Marshmallow (Android 6) or newer, you will not notice any battery drain. However, some unlucky devices may experience increased battery drain.

<h4><a name="speed">Will Blokada slow down my device?</a></h4>
<p>No. Depending on your settings Blokada can be quite efficient. In fact, both your device's performance and battery life may visibly improve, because Blokada saves your device from downloading and processing content you don't need or care about. However, users with some older devices may experience performance drop.</p>

<h4><a name="free">Is Blokada really free to use?</a></h4>
<p>Yes! Blokada started as my hobby project, is still mostly developed by me. It's my way of giving back to the community. Blokada is fully open source and it will stay free forever. That said, developing it takes a lot of time, so please consider supporting the project in any way you can (see below).</p>

<h4><a name="contribute">Blokada is great, how can I help the project?</a></h4>
